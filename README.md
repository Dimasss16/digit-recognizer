# digit-recognizer
This repository contains code for from-scratch NumPy neural network for MNIST handwritten digit recognition.

To run it, use Python 3.11, and `requirements.txt`. The code is provided in `digit_recognizer.ipynb` in Jupyter. Execute the cells to reproduce the baseline single-layer model and then switch to the two-layer version to see the improvement.
